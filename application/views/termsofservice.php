                    <h2 class="onlineheading59">For online tutoring</h2>

                    <h2>Scope:</h2>
                    <ul>
                    <li>For all contracts for the participation in tutoring with the Easy-Tutor GmbH, Barschweg 4, 81825 Munich (hereinafter referred to as "ET"), the following General Terms and Conditions apply exclusively. Deviations from these conditions and additional agreements must be made in writing. Different terms and conditions of the participant will be rejected.</li>
                    <li>These terms and conditions, as well as the online registration and the price stated therein constitute the entire contract between ET and the participant (hereinafter called TN). For the respective training section the current prices apply (visible on the website or at the time of booking). Previous prices lose their validity.</li>
                    <li>By registering for online tuition the participant accepts these terms and conditions.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <h2>Conclusion of contract</h2>
                    <ul>
                    <li>The agreement between TN and ET is concluded as soon as TN has booked tutoring online. Online registration is also valid without a signature. The contractual relationship between the TN and ET comes about at the time of the online registration.</li>
                    <li>ET is entitled to reject any application without giving reasons.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h2>Scope of services</h2>
                    <ul>
                     <li>ET makes it clear that the services provided are those of a service contract within the meaning of § 611 BGB. There are no distance learning courses, but personal student tutoring. For the success of the tutoring, for the correctness of the selection of subjects / courses (with or without appropriate consultation and / or application of test procedures) as well as possible professional recommendations ET takes over no guarantee.</li>
                     <li>The tuition services can be provided by third parties. Basically - especially with weekly and monthly bookings and / or seminars - the lessons should be as continuously as possible by a teacher. However, there is no claim to continuous performance or a specific teacher. ET strives to carefully select suitable people.</li>
                     </ul>

                    <h2>Prerequisite for Online Classes</h2>
                    <p>Participation in online instruction requires the availability of a PC or computer, smartphone or alternative technology with all Internet access and appropriate software at TN, for the TN has to ensure timely, as well as for the current availability of Internet. For missing or insufficient online connection TN alone is liable. Missing or inadequate equipment does not entitle you to withdraw from the contract. ET assumes no liability for this. ET shall also not be liable for any errors in any of the TN's equipment, systems, or software resulting from applications of programs, software, apps, etc. that have been uploaded to, downloaded from, or otherwise downloaded by TN from any Online Lesson Devices from TN have arrived,</p>

                    <h2>Booking and issuing tutoring sessions</h2>
                    <ul>
                    <li>Private tuition is booked as an individual lesson (alternatively à 90 minutes or à 45 min) in the calendar of the respective teacher. TN will receive a confirmation of participation by e-mail containing a link to online tutoring. TN has to make sure to appear on time for online tutoring.</li>
                    <li>TN can purchase current offers or savings packages (eg "20s card") for the booking of tutoring lessons. These are credited to the amount due for bookings of tutoring lessons after </li>
                    <li>The credit can be redeemed with a coupon code (alternatively the e-mail address that was specified when the credit was booked) when booking the online tutoring. Each coupon code is valid for 2 years.</li>
                    <li class="sublist_list">The austerity packages with monthly payment over a certain period of time are designed for a weekly booking of 90 minutes tutoring. But there is no obligation for a weekly booking. For example, if TN is absent for a long time due to holidays, follow-up lessons can be arranged. The total amount of each product is divided into six or twelve months and debited monthly in advance.</li>
                    <ul class="sub_listing">
                    <li>Upon purchase of the "50 savings package" TN receives a coupon code for the booking of 50 Nachhilfestunden (à 45 min). In addition, TN will receive a Wacom tablet on loan, which must be returned to ET at its own expense and at no cost at the end of its term.</li>
                    <li>Upon purchase of the "100-savings package" TN receives a coupon code for the booking of 100 Nachhilfestunden (à 45 min). This product includes a Wacom graphics tablet that TN may keep after the end of its term.</li>
                    </ul>
                    
                    </ul>

                    <h2>Payment</h2>
                    <p>The fees for tutoring are due when booking the tutoring and pay in advance by Paypal, credit card, invoice, Sofortüberweisung, giropay or SEPA direct debit.</p>

                    <h2>Termination</h2>
                    <p>Since Easy-Tutor can not conclude any contracts, subscriptions or the like, no cancellations are planned.</p>

                    <h2>Satisfaction Guarantee</h2>
                    <ul>
                    <li>ET offers the TN a satisfaction guarantee when purchasing the 50 or 100 hour package. TN may, without cause, stop the pending payments of the Product with immediate effect. The credited minute credit is reduced to 8 times 45 minutes of tuition, which can still be used up. This corresponds to the value of after hours of one month's contribution.</li>
                    <li>To use the Satisfaction <a href="mailto:stop@easy-tutor.de">Guarantee</a> , an email <a href="mailto:stop@easy-tutor.de">must be</a> sent to <a href="mailto:stop@easy-tutor.de">stop@easy-tutor.de</a> within four weeks of completion of the order .</li>
                    <li>The prerequisites here are that TN has not booked more than 8 times 45 minutes units during this time and that ET has been informed in due time.</li>
                    <li>The graphic tablet provided by ET is to be returned within 7 working days of sending the e-mail upon rescission of the respective package (a return slip for DHL is ready). ET reserves the right to bill TN for the graphics tablet (Hv 70 €) if the tablet does not arrive at ET within the above mentioned deadline.</li>
                    <li>The Satisfaction Guarantee offered by ET is not equivalent to a Money Back Guarantee. TN therefore has no right of refund of the amount debited by ET upon withdrawal. TN only has the right to stop the debit of the follow-up contributions.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h2>Cancellation and postponing of tutoring lessons</h2>
                    <ul>
                    <li>A shift of set hours by TN is possible up to 24 hours in advance. After this time, the failed hour will be charged. Exceptions to this - only in case of illness - are possible on the basis of goodwill by ET without any entitlement</li>
                    <li>Cancellation of a booked appointment by TN is not possible for technical reasons. Alternatively, TN has the option to postpone the appointment to a later date.</li>
                    <li>If ET postpones shifts / cancellations of specified hours, the relevant hours shall be made up at a timely time agreed with TN. Further claims which have been postponed or canceled by ET for TN may not exist, in particular TN waives all claims for damages which may arise from shifts / cancellations.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h2>Set-off / retention</h2>
                    <p>TN may only offset against ET's claims with legally established or undisputed claims. Counterclaims based on the same contractual relationship remain unaffected.

                            TN is only authorized to assert a right of retention to the extent that its counterclaim is based on the same contract and is undisputed or legally established.</p>

                    <h2>Invoice</h2>
                    <p>Complaints of the invoice amount must be communicated in writing by ET immediately, at the latest however six weeks after receipt of the invoice by ET. The omission of timely objections is considered approval. ET will point out in the invoices the consequences of a failure to timely objection. Statutory claims of the participant remain unaffected.</p>

                    <h2>Liability</h2>
                    <p>ET is fully liable for damage to life, body and health, if these damages are based on a grossly negligent or intentional breach of duty. ET continues to be liable for other damages due to intentional or grossly negligent behavior. For all other damages liability is excluded.</p>
